# Other tips

## Taking the bullet train
- If you're taking the bullit train try sitting on the side of mount fuji. Its a great view
- Buy some bento boxes at train stations before riding

## 7 eleven or Family mart
There are lots of 24/7 supermarkets. I'd recommend just going there and trying random stuff out.

## Check for festivals
If you're going in the summer. Lots of chances you're going on a holiday or festival period. Japanese festivals are really cute with everyone wearing kimonos and lots of food stalls.

## Clubbing & bars
Don't forget to go clubbing! I don't have any experience with it tho.

## Mount Fuji
Only accessible in the summer. Everyone goes at night to see the sunrise. Its a tough hike. be prepared! Headlights and good shoes etc.

# Nara
Nara is close to osaka and kyoto. Its a nice day trip. They also have this famous mochi place. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmSrULDVRPc

# Ichiran
Ichiran is a ramen chain. Its a very interesting experience so definetly go there!

# Parks, museums and castles
There are a lot of other stuff like parks and more touristy stuff. I didn't list those.

# Conveyor belt sushi
When going to a conveyor belt sushi place it might be overwhelming. You can pick whatever plate is on the belt. But you can also order them by just calling what you want. Therefor you need to know the names. Just imitate the people around you.

## Yakitori // Izakaya
Go for yakitori at places like Torikizoku. Its a place where you can order whatever skewer you want and beer. The food is amazing.
